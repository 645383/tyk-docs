The Dashboard Admin API is a special bootstrapping API that can be used to set up and provision a Tyk Dashboard instance without the command line and is used by the bootstrap scripts that come with Tyk On Premise installations.

> Note: This API should only be used for bootstrapping purposes, all actual interactions with dashboard objects should be done via the regular API.
