The main customisation that can be done with the dashboard is via the CSS Editor.

#### Step 1: Open CSS Editor

To open the CSS Editor, open the CSS option in the "Portal Management" section of the navigation:

![Portal management menu][1]

#### Step 2: Make CSS amendments

In the CSS Editor, add the classes that you would like to override in the home page. For cloud and hybrid users, this will already be filled in with some initial overrides for you:

#### Step 3: Make email CSS amendments

If you wish to customise how emails are displayed to end-users, then you can also add new classes to the Email CSS editor, these classes will be added in-line to the email that is sent out:

![Email CSS editor][3]

Once you have finished making your changes, click the "Update" button, the new CSS should be available almost immediately on your site.
