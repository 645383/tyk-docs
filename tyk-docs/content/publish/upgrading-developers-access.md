A common requirement when managing developers in the API developer portal is to upgrade or downgrade their access level depending on their billing rate or subscription level.

This guide will show you step-by-step how to upgrade a developers access in the developer portal:

#### Step 1: View the developer profile

Browse to the developers list view and select the developer that you wish to manage.

#### Step 2: Scroll down to their subscriptions list

This sections shows you the current policy that the developer has access to, this view will always try to match the access level to a catalogue entry, if the policy assigned to a developer is not in the catalogue, the entry will read "(No Catalogue Entry)". We recommend that all policy levels are in your catalogue, even if they are not all live.

#### Step 3: Select the "Change Policy" button

This will open a pop-up window that shows you all available policies that can be assigned to the token for the end user.
