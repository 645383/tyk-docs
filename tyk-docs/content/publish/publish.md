The Tyk Developer Portal is a small CMS-like system that enables you to expose a facade of your APIs and then allow third-party developers to register and use your APIs.

The developer portal enables you to:

*   Host pages written in Markdown to discuss your API and product.
*   Use Bootstrap-based templates to completely customise the look and feel.
*   Host your API documentation in Swagger or API Blueprint for developers to use. In the case of Swagger, we use Swagger UI so that the developer sees a sandbox to interact with your published APIs. For Swagger you can also link to a public Swagger hosted URL, which can then be rendered by using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
*   Unlike other platforms, Tyk will not auto-publish your APIs to the Portal, instead they are presented as a facade, you choose what APIs and what Policies to expose to the Portal.
*   Fully control the flow of the developer sign-up and enrollment.

The developer Portal is available to Pro (On-Premises), Cloud and Hybrid users.
