Tyk has multiple integration options with third parties, and these integrations can occur in a few places:

* Within the Gateway itself using Dynamic JS Middleware (Hybrid or On-Premise only)
* Externally to the gateway using a broker (The Tyk Identity Broker) (On-Premise only)
* Built-in federation support via JSON Web Tokens or Open ID Connect (Cloud, Hybrid and On-Premise)

All three of the above have different and unique use cases and can be deployed differently depending on your platform and integration requirements.
