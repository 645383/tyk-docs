Tyk comes in three powerful flavours: Cloud, Hybrid and On-Premise, each has it’s own strengths and reasons for deployment. To get started, why not check out the guides?

- Tyk Cloud: The fastest way to explore Tyk – no setup, no installations, just a straight-up cloud-based API gateway and proxy.
- Tyk Hybrid: Get the best of both worlds, manage things from our cloud but get a full API gateway in your infrastructure.
- Tyk On-Premise: A full Tyk stack in your own infrastructure, it doesn’t call home, it’s all yours and you can do with it what you like, this is the most flexible Tyk deployment you could have.
