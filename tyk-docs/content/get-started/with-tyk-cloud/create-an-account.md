To create an account with Tyk Cloud is very quick and free, to do:

Visit our Tyk [Cloud Signup Page][1] and enter your details:

![Tyk Cloud signup form][2]

Your company name will be used to generate your cloud endpoint, this is where your API Developer Portal will be hosted, and also your Tyk Cloud API endpoints for any APIs that you create.

> **Note:** If you change the password in your cloud account page it will not change the password in your Cloud Dashboard.

Then click "Login to your dashboard":

This will present you with a new login screen for our cloud dashboard. You can login directly from <https://admin.cloud.tyk.io>. The username and password will be the same as those used to create your account.
