## What is Tyk Developer Edition?

Tyk Developer Edition is the open-source API Gateway that is developed by our community and supported by our community members and advocates (with some help from the Tyk Technologies team). The Tyk Developer Edition is an On-Premises install that consists of:

* Tyk API Gateway: The API Gateway that can manage your APIs.
* Tyk Pump: An analytics data sink, used to send analytics data to platforms such as StatsD, ElasticSearch and InfluxDB.
* Tyk Identity Broker: A third-party IDP integration service.

All of the above projects are available as open-source implementations on our [Github pages][1].

>Note: Tyk Dashboard is not available for this edition.
